## Shared Technical Concerns

### Creation of high quality components in restricted time frame

A well used component library is to be used to create accessible components of high quility in a short amount of time.

Prefereably this library also provides line graph and table components.

### Cohesive visual experience

The use of a component library will help provide a cohesive layout.

Use of function oriented colors such as "focus-color", "hover-color", "primary-color" etc will provide visual cohesion.
